### 1. **Introduction to PHP**

#### What is PHP?
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language used for creating dynamic web pages. It's primarily used for web development but can also be used as a general-purpose programming language.

#### Why use PHP?
PHP is popular for several reasons:
- Open-source and free
- Easy to learn for beginners
- Highly flexible and integrates well with databases like MySQL
- Large community support

#### How PHP works
PHP code is executed on the server, and the result (usually HTML) is sent to the client browser. For example, when you visit a page like `index.php`, the server processes the PHP code and sends back HTML to be displayed in the browser.

#### Setting up your environment
To run PHP on your local machine, you'll need a web server and PHP installed. The easiest way to get started is by using a local development stack such as XAMPP, WAMP, or LAMP. These tools include Apache (the web server), MySQL (the database), and PHP in one package.

### 2. **Basic PHP Syntax**

#### PHP Tags and Syntax Structure
PHP code is embedded within HTML using PHP tags. The syntax starts with `<?php` and ends with `?>`. Here's a simple example:

```php
<?php
  echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

#### Echo and Print
Both `echo` and `print` are used to display output, but `echo` can take multiple parameters, while `print` can only take one. `echo` is faster than `print` but the difference is negligible in most cases.

```php
<?php
  echo "Hello, World!";
  print "Welcome to PHP!";
?>
```

#### Variables and Data Types
Variables in PHP start with a `$` sign. PHP is loosely typed, meaning you don't have to specify the data type when declaring a variable.

```php
<?php
  $name = "John";  // String
  $age = 25;       // Integer
  $height = 5.9;    // Float
  $isStudent = true; // Boolean
?>
```

#### Comments
PHP supports single-line and multi-line comments:

```php
<?php
  // This is a single-line comment

  /* This is a
     multi-line comment */
?>
```

### 3. **Operators**

#### Arithmetic Operators
PHP supports basic arithmetic operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.

```php
<?php
  $a = 5;
  $b = 3;
  echo $a + $b;  // 8
  echo $a - $b;  // 2
?>
```

#### Assignment Operators
You can assign values to variables using `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.

```php
<?php
  $a = 10;
  $a += 5;  // $a is now 15
?>
```

#### Comparison Operators
These operators are used to compare two values. Examples include `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`.

```php
<?php
  $a = 10;
  $b = 20;
  var_dump($a == $b);  // false
  var_dump($a < $b);   // true
?>
```

#### Logical Operators
PHP supports logical operators like `&&`, `||`, and `!` to combine conditions.

```php
<?php
  $a = true;
  $b = false;
  var_dump($a && $b);  // false
  var_dump($a || $b);  // true
?>
```
